#The GifTastic Project*


This project is a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. 

The GIPHY API is called to change the HTML of the site, utilizing the user's chosen topic.

The user can add more buttons of emotions and keep populating the page with the desired emotion or topic.

Each gif has their given title and rating. The gifs can be saved by the user, by right-clicking on the image and saving it.
